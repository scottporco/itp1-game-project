# Game Project: Base Game and Extensions

link to project: https://scottporco.github.io/itp1-game-project/

## Overview

This project involves the creation of a fully functional, bug-free game with several required features and optional extensions. The main tasks involve player interaction, level design, aesthetics, and ensuring the code is well-structured and error-free.

### Base Game Requirements:

The base game must include the following features:
1. **Player Interaction**: Ensure the player can control the character smoothly with responsive controls.
2. **Canyons & Coins Interaction**: Implement the interaction between the player, canyons, and coins. Players should be able to collect coins and interact with canyons accordingly.
3. **Scrollable Game World**: Implement a scrollable game world that moves as the player progresses.
4. **Score and Lives Counters**: Display the player's score and number of lives on the screen. Update these based on game events.
5. **Game Over States**: Include logic to end the game when conditions are met (e.g., when the player loses all lives).

### Aesthetics and Gameplay:

In addition to functionality, the gameplay and aesthetics are important and will be graded. You can score highly by:
- **Challenging Level Design**: Make the game engaging and challenging for players.
- **Coherent Graphics and Animations**: Use visually appealing and consistent graphics and animations throughout the game.
- **Well-Tweaked Player Controls**: Ensure that player controls (e.g., jumping) are finely tuned for smooth gameplay.
- **Bug-Free Game**: Make sure the game is bug-free and functions as intended.

### Code Quality:

You will be graded on the quality of your code. Make sure to review and improve the following:
- **Indentation & Whitespace**: Properly use indentation and whitespace (empty lines and spaces).
- **Inline Comments**: Include relevant inline comments, but avoid leaving commented-out code in the final submission.
- **Consistent Variable Naming**: Use consistent and logical names for variables.
- **Code Organization**: Organize your code efficiently.
- **Avoid Redundancy**: Ensure there are no implicitly declared or redundant variables, declarations, or assignments.
- **Appropriate Use of Local/Global Variables**: Use local and global variables appropriately.
- **Correct Array Traversal**: Implement array traversal properly.
- **Data Structures & Functions**: Use rational design in your data structures and functions.
- **Clear Conditional Logic**: Implement conditional logic clearly and simply.
- **Anchored Game Elements**: Ensure that game elements are properly anchored.

Refer to the code philosophy videos such as "The Debugger's Mindset," "Testing," and "The Elegant Coder" for guidance.

## Extensions:

After completing the base game, you can add up to three extensions. Each extension will be graded based on functionality, creativity, and ambition.

### Available Extensions:

1. **Add Sounds**: Use the `p5.sound` library to add sound effects to your game. Follow the tutorial from the topic to implement this.
2. **Create Platforms**: Use the factory pattern to create platforms. This allows the game to generate platforms dynamically.
3. **Create Enemies**: Use a constructor function to create enemies. Enemies should have distinct behaviors and interact with the player.

You are free to enhance these extensions beyond the basic implementation covered in the tutorials. You can use advanced techniques, such as ES6 syntax and code modularization, but these are optional and should be used consistently to demonstrate understanding.

## Deliverables:

You are required to submit the following in a compressed `.zip` file:
1. **Final Game Project Code**: Include all the code needed to run the game.
2. **Assets**: Include all necessary assets, such as HTML files, library files, images, sound files, etc.
3. **Commentary (PDF format, ~250 words)**: Provide a commentary describing the following:
   - Your chosen extension(s)
   - Challenges and difficulties encountered
   - Skills you learned or practiced while completing the project
